description:
  I love <a href='http://jekyllbootstrap.com'>Jekyll Bootstrap</a> and
  <a href='http://pages.github.com'>GitHub</a> as a blog platform &mdash; so much so
  that I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll write posts more often than once a year. Really.
  As a frontend developer and pixel-pusher, it might be the most pleasurable way to
  blog that I&rsquo;ve tried yet. Not that I&rsquo;ve tried much, but hear me out.
