<h2>Introduce</h2>

<p class="intro">
After <em>10+</em> years of R &amp; D experience in IT field , I have gotten an insight on the development and research. I has taken part in developing equipments of various forms, including network equipments, terminal equipments and test equipments, which give me the opportunity to build a more <em>complete body of knowledge</em> in communication industry, to learn and take <em>the best pratices</em> of organization, development, testing and integration methods of R &amp; D area.
</p>

<p class="intro">
No matter What kind of work I engaged in, I would like to keep a humility and practical style. I will try my best to be best, even though I may not good enough to be.

    <p>
As product manager of several projects, I realize that user-oriented development is always the most important principle. Keep in touch with the market and users in the all stages of developing, otherwise you may produce something <em>never be used</em>.

<p class="job-description">
&gt;&gt;&gt; R &amp; D job：Team Leader of "Routing Team" <br>
Tasks of "Routing Team" includes: <br>
Wireless routing protocols, link layer protocols, IP protocol suite, application-related protocols, service QoS related. These modules implement the basic functionality of network <em> switches and routers</em>. Meanwhile, in order to adapt to needs of industrial users, such as ports, rail transportation and power industry, the team will design and develop custom network structure and communication protocols.
<br>
These modules include: <br>
 + L2 : VLAN(include QinQ)， Bridge(Switch)，Port-Binding, STP/RSTP/MSTP, IGMP Snoop <br>
 + Network Service:  PPPoE, NTP/SNTP, DHCP, IDS/IDP, Radius  <br>
 + L3： NAT(DNAT, PAT, TransNAT);  Routing Protocol(OSPF, RIP) <br>
 + Traffic Control:  <br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  - Portal(comformance with CMCC specification) <br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  - Speed Control (UL/DL, per user, per device, per SSID) <br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  - Filter(IP, Port, Protocol, Content) <br>
 + Data Tunnel: DTLS, IPsec <br>
 + AP Control: CAPWAP <br>
<br>
Most modules include kernel part and user part, the former is responsible for functional processing, the latter is responsible for configuration and information collection interface. <br>
The modules I developed include: <br>
   ● <em>Wireless roting</em>module  <br>
- For mesh network, implement a MANET(Mobile Ad-hoc Networks) protocol, which is suitable for the scenes not very sensitive to delay
<br>
- For fast moving scenes, design to decrease the delay and bandwidth loss during handover between different AP.<br>
<br>
   ● DHCP module  <br>
DHCP module includes three sub-modules: Server, Client and Relay. Both DHCP Server and Relay are VLAN aware，in other words, can have distinct configuration for each VLAN. The DHCP Server support static address binding, online failover backup, IPv4 or IPv6 adress pool， and configurable Options，such as WLAN related  Option 43, 82, 60. <br>
<br>
   ● IGMP Snoop module <br>
To avoid sending unnecessary multicast to switch ports，a IGMP snoop should exist to snoop the status the client of each IGMP group, and only the port existing active user need to forward the multicast. Support IGMP v2.<br>
<br>
   ● MSTP module  <br>
A implement of IEEE 802.1s, mapping each VLAN to a certain Instance, each of which maintain its own status of Spanning Tree. This module interacts with Bridge module to set the forwarding status of VLANs on the port. <br>
<br>
   ● TCP Performance Enhancement module<br>
The TCP protocol is invented in situation of  wired network,  and its main error-resist mechanism is designed for network congestion. Usually detection of packet loss will trigger the procedure of "Congest Control" with a "Slow-Start", which then will dramatically decrease the rate of date flow. This module monitor the establishment of each TCP connetction, remove the "loss" information, and resend loss packets from its inner buffer. It has several resend policies(such as "fastest", "smooth"). The tests show it is very effective to smooth the data flow in high loss rate environment . It can work in L2 or L3. The main achievement has applied for patent(No. 200810207789.2） <br>
<br>
   ● IDS module  <br>
Support detecting of malformed packet, flood attack, and port scan. The detection types are compliant with Cisco Secure IDS Attack Signatures” (not include the attack above transport layer). <br>
All the port scan performed by Nmap can be detected.<br>
<br>
   ● Ported modules  <br>
Porting some modules developed by 3rd party, and writing configuration wrappers. The modules include: NTP Server/Client; PPPoE Server(support Radius)/Client <br>
